    "Solvers were first introduced in the [Band structure](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/bands.html) section and then used throughout the tutorial to present the results of the various models we constructed. This section will take a more detailed look at the concrete [`lapack()`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.solver.html#pybinding.solver.lapack) and [`arpack()`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.solver.html#pybinding.solver.arpack) eigenvalue solvers and their common [`Solver`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.solver.html#pybinding.solver.Solver) interface.\n",

    "## LAPACK\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`Solver`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.solver.html#pybinding.solver.Solver) class establishes the interface of a solver within pybinding, but it does not contain a concrete diagonalization routine. For this reason we never instantiate the plain solver, only its implementations such as [`solver.lapack()`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.solver.html#pybinding.solver.lapack).\n",
    "\n",
    "The LAPACK implementation works on dense matrices which makes it well suited only for small systems. However, a great advantage of this solver is that it always solves for all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hamiltonian matrix. This makes it perfect for calculating the entire band structure of the bulk or nanoribbons, as has been shown several times in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, this solver uses the [`scipy.linalg.eigh()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.eigh.html#scipy.linalg.eigh) function for dense Hermitian matrices. See the [`solver.lapack()`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.solver.html#pybinding.solver.lapack) API reference for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ARPACK\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`solver.arpack()`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.solver.html#pybinding.solver.arpack) implementation works on sparse matrices which makes it suitable for large systems. However, only a small subset of the total eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be calculated. This tutorial already contains a few examples where the ARPACK solver was used, and one more is presented below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, the [`scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh.html#scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh) function is used to solve large sparse Hermitian matrices. The first argument to [`solver.arpack()`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.solver.html#pybinding.solver.arpack) must be the pybinding [`Model`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.Model.html#pybinding.Model), but the following arguments are the same as [`eigsh()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh.html#scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh), so the solver routine can be tweaked as desired. Rather than reproduce the full list of options here, we refer you to the scipy [`eigsh()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh.html#scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh) reference documentation. Here, we will focus on the specific features of solvers within pybinding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solver interface\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter which concrete solver is used, they all share a common [`Solver`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.solver.html#pybinding.solver.Solver) interface. The two primary properties are [`eigenvalues`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.solver.html#pybinding.solver.Solver.eigenvalues) and [`eigenvectors`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.solver.html#pybinding.solver.Solver.eigenvectors). These are the raw results of the exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix."
