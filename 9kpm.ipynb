    "# Kernel polynomial method\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel polynomial method (KPM) can be used to quickly compute various physical properties of very large tight-binding systems. It makes use of Chebyshev polynomial expansion together with damping kernels. Pybinding includes a fast [`kpm()`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.chebyshev.html#pybinding.chebyshev.kpm) implementation with several easy-to-use computation methods as well as a low-level interface for computing KPM expansion moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Download this page as a Jupyter notebook](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/_downloads/kpm.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## About KPM\n",
    "\n",
    "For a full review of the kernel polynomial method, see the reference paper [Rev. Mod. Phys. 78, 275 (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.78.275). Here, we shall only briefly describe the main characteristics of KPM and some specifics of its implementation in pybinding.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw on the previous page, exactly solving a tight-binding problem implies the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix. However, the computational resources required by eigenvalue solvers scale up rapidly with system size which makes it challenging to solve realistically large systems. A fundamentally different approach is to set aside the requirement for exact solutions (avoid diagonalization altogether) and instead use approximative methods to calculate the properties of interest. This is the main idea behind KPM which approximates functions as a series of Chebyshev polynomials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approximative nature of the method presents an opportunity for additional performance tuning. Results may be computed very quickly with low accuracy to get an initial estimate for the problem at hand. Once final results are required, the accuracy can be increased at the cost of longer computation time. Within pybinding, this KPM calculation quality is frequently expressed as an energy broadening parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great benefits of this method is that spatially dependent properties such as the local density of states (LDOS) or Greenâ€™s function are calculated separately for each spatial position. This means that localized properties can be computed extremely quickly. For this application, KPM can be seen as orthogonal to traditional eigenvalue solvers. Sparse diagonalization produces results for a very small energy range (eigenvalues) but does so for all positions simultaneously (eigenvectors). With KPM, it's possible to separate and compute individual positions but for the entire energy spectrum at once. In this way, the two approaches complement each other nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Builtin methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using any of the computation methods, the main [`KPM`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.chebyshev.html#pybinding.chebyshev.KPM) object needs to be created for a specific model:\n",

    "model = pb.Model(...)\n",
    "kpm = pb.kpm(model)\n",
    "# ... use kpm\n",

    "### LDOS\n",

    "The [`KPM.calc_ldos()`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.chebyshev.html#pybinding.chebyshev.KPM.calc_ldos) method makes it very easy to calculate the local density of states (LDOS). In the next example we'll use a large square sheet of pristine graphene:"

    "\n",
    "Thanks to KPM, the calculation of this local property is very fast: about 0.1 seconds for the example above with a 60 x 60 nm sheet of graphene. The broadening parameter offers the possibility for performance tuning -- calculation time is inversely proportional to broadening width. KPM performs the computation for the entire spectrum simultaneously, so the selected energy range and the number of sample points have almost no effect on performance. The broadening width (i.e. the precision of the results) is the main factor which determines the duration of the calculation.\n",

This allows the [`Series.plot()`](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/tutorial/../_api/pybinding.Series.html#pybinding.Series.plot) method to automatically plot a nicely labeled line plot, as seen above.

The pronounced zero-energy peak is due to zigzag edge states and the additional higher-energy DOS peaks reflect the quantized band structure of the narrow nanoribbon.\n",
    "\n",
    "A specific feature of the KPM-based DOS calculation is that it can be approximated very quickly using stochastic methods. Instead of computing the density of states at each sites individually and summing up the results, the DOS is calculated for all sites at the same time, but with a random contribution of each site. By repeating this procedure multiple times with different random staring states, the full DOS is recovered. This presents an additional knob for performance/quality tuning via the `num_random` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we keep `num_random` low to keep the calculation time under 1 second. Increasing this number would smooth out the DOS further. Luckily, the stochastic evaluation converges as a function of both the system size and number of random samples. Thus, the larger the model system, the smaller `num_random` needs to be for the same result quality.\n",
